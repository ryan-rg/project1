		<td>In English we are doing a project that is called "What we keep" which is where we write stories on the importance of three seperate objects. Each of these objects have different importance to our lives where we discribe and give bacround detail about a past object, present object, and an object that represent out hopes and dreams. In a series pf documents we  have completed several ruft drafts that give an outline of what each story will look like. Our final product includes pictures and very descriptive imagery and pathos to explain our connnection to each object.</td>
		<td> Our math project is where we use lessons of domani and range that we have learned in this class to creat a linear box. We have used a series of documents that lead us up to out final product which is a linear points made out of an equation and domain and range. Our box is required to have an open and close lid of the box and to do this I assined my line to the variable a and used a sl8ider to make my box move.
